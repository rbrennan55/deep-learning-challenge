# Module 21 - Deep Learning Challenge Report

### Overview:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

  The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df is the target variable
  
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?

  The "APPLICATION_TYPE" , "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT" columns are the features
  
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

  The "EIN & "NAME" columns were removed because they are neither targets or features.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

 2 iterations were completed:

    - 1st attempt: 2 hidden layers plus an outer layer, 
        layer 1: 20 neurons - relu activation
        layer 2: 10 neurons - relu activation
        Outer layer: 1 unit - sigmoid activation & adam optimizers as the complier.
        25 epoch

    - 2nd attempt: 3 hidden layers plus an outer layer, 
        layer 1: 30 neurons - relu activation
        layer 2: 20 neurons - relu activation
        layer 2: 10 neurons - relu activation
        Outer layer: 1 unit - sigmoid activation & adam optimizers as the complier.
        50 epoch


- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

  No, the target model performance was not met. The highest score acheived was 73%
  
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

  Attempts were made to add a hidden layer and increase neuron nodes.
