# Module 21 - Deep Learning Challenge Report

### Overview:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

## Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

### Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
