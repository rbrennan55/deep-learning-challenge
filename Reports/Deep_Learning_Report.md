# Module 21 - Deep Learning Challenge Report

### Overview:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

  The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df is the target variable
  
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?

  The "APPLICATION_TYPE" , "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT" columns are the features
  
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

  The "EIN & "NAME" columns were removed because they are neither targets or features.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

 2 iterations were completed:

    - 1st attempt: 2 hidden layers plus an outer layer, 
        layer 1: 20 neurons - relu activation
        layer 2: 10 neurons - relu activation
        Outer layer: 1 unit - sigmoid activation & adam optimizers as the complier.
        25 epoch

    - 2nd attempt: 3 hidden layers plus an outer layer, 
        layer 1: 30 neurons - relu activation
        layer 2: 20 neurons - relu activation
        layer 2: 10 neurons - relu activation
        Outer layer: 1 unit - sigmoid activation & adam optimizers as the complier.
        50 epoch


- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

  No, the target model performance was not met. The highest score acheived was 73%
  
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

  Attempts were made to add a hidden layer and increase neuron nodes.
